# JavaScript Mastery Series
## Description
Welcome to the JavaScript Mastery Series! This repository is dedicated to my journey of mastering JavaScript by creating a total of 150 projects: 50 frontend projects, 50 backend projects, and 50 full-stack projects.

### Why JavaScript?
JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language used for both client-side and server-side development. By diving deep into various aspects of JavaScript, I aim to solidify my understanding and become proficient in building robust and dynamic applications.

## Project Goals:
- 50 Frontend Projects: These will cover various aspects of frontend development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as modern libraries and frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.
- 50 Backend Projects: These projects will delve into server-side development using Node.js, Express, and other backend technologies.
- 50 Full-Stack Projects: Combining both frontend and backend skills, these projects will focus on building comprehensive, full-stack applications.
